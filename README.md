# Number_Guessing_Game

I have written a program which is a game that picks any number from 1 to 100 and the players need to guess the number with the following tips from the program :- 

1) If the player's guess is higher than the generated number then the program will print "Enter lower number please".
2) If the player's guess is lower than the generated number then the program will print "Enter higher number please".
3) If the player's guesses the right number then the program will print "The number of guesses, player used to arrive at the number".
